Slaves And Freedmen Prepared Paragraph
Whenever you traveled in Rome you would find slaves.
They belonged to a master or mistress and had to give
complete obidience to them.
They were not free to make desisions for themselves.
They could not marry, nor could they own any personal
possesions and were not protected by the laws of court.
They were not regarded as people, rather as things
that could be sold bought and sold, treated well or
badely, according to the whims of their master.
Slaves carried out much of the hard work, but also
took part in many skilled trades and occupations.
They did not live separately to free people and were
often found working together around the house.
Romans regarded slaves as necessary and a part of life
and no-one made any serious attempt to abolish it.
People usually became slaves by being taken
prisoner of war or being captured by pirates, and
their children were automatically born into slavery.
